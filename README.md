### Purpose

This was a class focused on the production of a 2D game within a small team, using the Unity 3D game engine. Throughout the semester we learned the main stages of game production, while working as a programmer, artist or designer on a single game project. In doing so, we learned the basics of game design in a practical, hands-on setting.

Our team, Mopping Dad, set out to make a 2D platforming game. In it, the ninja frog finds himself lost in a den of killer rabbits. He must survive an endless wave of attacks using basic attacks, blocks and  dodges. 

We originally used Sourcetree and BitBucket to handle source control. I lost access to this after leaving University and only had these locally stored copies of the project.
